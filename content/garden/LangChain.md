### LangChain - a framework for developing applications powered by language models.

LangChain provides standard interfaces and integrations for working with LLMs, retrieving application data, and directing agent behavior. It features composable components as well as pre-built chains for accomplishing common tasks. The goal is to simplify the process of leveraging LLMs to build context-aware, reasoning-based applications.
Some key capabilities provided by LangChain include:

• Interfacing with LLMs like GPT-3, Codex, and open source models
• Retrieving documents, databases, knowledge bases to provide context 
• Tools and templates to quickly build chatbots, QA systems, data analysis apps
• Monitoring, testing, and debugging chains
• Deploying chains via REST API or serverless functions

The components of Langchain are:
- Prompts
- Chains
- Models
- Indexes
- Agents
