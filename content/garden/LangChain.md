## LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.

LangChain provides standard interfaces and integrations for working with LLMs, retrieving application data, and directing agent behavior. It features composable components as well as pre-built chains for accomplishing common tasks. The goal is to simplify the process of leveraging LLMs to build context-aware, reasoning-based applications.
Some key capabilities provided by LangChain include:

• Interfacing with LLMs like GPT-3, Codex, and open source models
• Retrieving documents, databases, knowledge bases to provide context 
• Tools and templates to quickly build chatbots, QA systems, data analysis apps
• Monitoring, testing, and debugging chains
• Deploying chains via REST API or serverless functions

--------------------------

Here are some quick notes about specific parts involved while developing a *conversational agent* with langchain:

##### Langchain embeddings 
Embeddings module within the LangChain framework. This module provides an interface for working with text embedding models from various providers like OpenAI, Hugging Face, Cohere, etc.

• Standardized API for different embedding model providers 
• Methods for embedding documents and embedding queries 
• Creating vector representations of text that can be used for semantic search 
• Integrating embedding models into downstream tasks like building chatbots
