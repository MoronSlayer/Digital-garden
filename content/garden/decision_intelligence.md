## The first lesson in decision analysis - the difference between a decision and an outcome

**Outcome bias** is one society's favorite forms of mass irrationality.

#### What is a decision? 
It is an irrevocable allocation of resources - money, physical resources or the opportunity cost of making a choice.

#### What is an outcome?
An outcome is how things turn out later.

It's possible to make a good decision and have an outcome that's not so good as a result.

An outcome has 2 components: 
- The quality of decison that went into it 
- Luck or randomness

In many complex situations in life, there is that random component. 

If all you observe is the outcome and you don't get to see anything about what was know at the time the decision was being made, you'll end up punishing or rewarding people for a combination of luck and decision ability. (How much of that is luck?)

> **Always evaluate decisions based on only what was known at the time of making the decision.**

"Oh, let's just see how things turn out to be, before we judge it"
You don't need to see how things turn out. You need to see what was know at the time that decision was made.

Even if you think about some of the important decisions you've made in your own life, if you didn't write anything down about what you knew at that time, and now all you get to observe is outcomes, you'll learn the wrong lessons from your own decisions. You'll forget what you knew and what you learned later. A lot of things will make sense in hindsight, and you'll forget that you didn't actually know that information right then. That's called **hindsight bias**.

- Which factors did this decision maker actually consider? 
- How did they go about gathering their information? 
- Which information sources did they use? 
- Did they get the right amount of information based on what was at stake with that decision? 

That's what you'll want to look at. 

> For **important** decisions, **document** the process.

### What makes some decsions more difficult than others? 

The fewer options you have to choose from, the easier the decision can be chosen.
