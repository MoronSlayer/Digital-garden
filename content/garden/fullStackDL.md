In the recent past, I've graduated with a Master's in AI. Through this journey I've learnt a lot but have also realized the importance of more whole-rounded knowledge required as I try taking these skills to production. Hence, I've started doing the [Full stack deep learning course](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/course/). With this, I aim to get more in-depth skills required of ML practioners in the industry.

Learning the fundamental concepts of deep learning is the beginning. In a production setting where a deep learning model is deployed in an application, there are more components such as GPU cloud, experiment tracking, model serving and monitoring involved.
