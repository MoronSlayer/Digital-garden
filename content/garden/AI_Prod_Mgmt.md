# What is AI? 

Giving cognitive capabilities to machines

## Currently most used subfields of AI

- **Machine Learning** - A branch of AI that focuses on the use of data and algorithms to 
imitate the way humans learn and gradually improve its accuracy.
- **Deep Learning** - A type of AI that can process a wider range of data types (e.g. images 
and sound) and often produces more accurate results than traditional machine learning.
- **NLP** - technology that helps machines process and 
understand human language so that they can automatically perform repetitive tasks.

# How Product Managers should think of AI 
- A tool to help build your product
- A capability you can build into your product

> How can AI have 10 times the impact on software provided to customers and how can it provide 10 times the value to companies ? 

> AI should make software ***exponentially*** better

While leadership is bullish on AI considering it's unknown impacts, induviduals who actually utilize this technology don't necessarily share this feeling.

AI will not replace Product managers now or in the future, but rather offers a tool to automate and speed up certain tasks.

## AI's place in building products

1. **Data Analysis** - Automatically recognize patterns and trends in a data set. Collecting, analyzing and distilling quantitative data like product usage and user journeys; and qualitative data like customer feedback.
Decision making examples include: 
- Product discovery
- Roadmap planning
- Product-led growth strategies
2. **Experimentation** - Learn what's working and implement changes quickly.
For e.g., AI can suggest what to test for multi-variant feature testing and even run tests automatically
3. **Communication** - Automate the creation of key product documentation.

Product managers are constantly communicating about ideas, priorities and plans. With so many cross-functional partners, AI can automate creation of things like user stories, product requirement documents, release notes, and more.
