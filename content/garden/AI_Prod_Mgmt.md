### What is AI? 

Giving cognitive capabilities to machines

### Currently most used subfields of AI

- **Machine Learning** - A branch of AI that focuses on the use of data and algorithms to 
imitate the way humans learn and gradually improve its accuracy.
- **Deep Learning** - A type of AI that can process a wider range of data types (e.g. images 
and sound) and often produces more accurate results than traditional machine learning.
- **NLP** - technology that helps machines process and 
understand human language so that they can automatically perform repetitive tasks.

### How Product Managers should think of AI 
- A tool to help build your product
- A capability you can build into your product

> How can AI have 10 times the impact on software provided to customers and how can it provide 10 times the value to companies ? 

> AI should make software ***exponentially*** better

While leadership is bullish on AI considering it's unknown impacts, induviduals who actually utilize this technology don't necessarily share this feeling.

AI will not replace Product managers now or in the future, but rather offers a tool to automate and speed up certain tasks.

### AI's place in building products

1. **Data Analysis** - Automatically recognize patterns and trends in a data set. Collecting, analyzing and distilling quantitative data like product usage and user journeys; and qualitative data like customer feedback.
Decision making examples include: 
- Product discovery
- Roadmap planning
- Product-led growth strategies
2. **Experimentation** - Learn what's working and implement changes quickly.
For e.g., AI can suggest what to test for multi-variant feature testing and even run tests automatically
3. **Communication** - Automate the creation of key product documentation.

Product managers are constantly communicating about ideas, priorities and plans. With so many cross-functional partners, AI can automate creation of things like user stories, product requirement documents, release notes, and more.

Product Managers will still require to maintain effective communication, meaning  truly being present and communicative with customers, engineers, stakeholders and cross-functional teams. This will help us understand and articulate whether we're solving the right problems and providing enough details for others to do their jobs well.

####  2 Areas of Product Management AI will amplify:
- Being customer centric
- Having good business sense

By augmenting work AI, product managers can create and innovate more.


--- 

Modern Product Managers need to drive business outcomes, AI can help to drive those outcomes faster and more efficiently, freeing them up to provide **more value to customers**.

Some use cases of AI for product managers are:

-  faster page and feature tracking
- understanding customer workflows to pull out key insights
- analyze customer feedback
- optimizing prodcut roadmap
- prioritizing which features to build
- generating user stories and personas
- backlog management 
- creating in-app content
- tailoring worklows to give a highly personalized experience to users
 
### Adapting your software strategy in the AI era

AI will impact product management by changing the way managers analyze quantitative and qualitative data. Also shaping the in-product experience and users' abilities. Just like the iPhone created a revolution in the cellphone space, AI is a modern revolution and companies will have to adapt.

### Questions to consider on how you might bring AI to your product

1. What parts on your product need to change? 

Use product analytics to identify areas of friction, creating friction-free experiences for users. Use user and behaviour data as required to identify opportunities and improvements with AI.

2. What areas of your product will remain?

3. What completely new additions to your product are now possible?

> **Establish foundational AI principles for your organization so that everyone in your product and engineering organization is aligned on your approach with AI and can refer back to the principles at any time.**

#### Four levels of AI

{{< figure src="./four_levels.png"  width="100%" >}}

- Level 1: There is no involvement from AI and everything is manual.
- Level 2: The process is still manual and driven by the human, but AI is there 
to assist, provide insights, and give recommendations.
- Level 3: AI drives the process and the human is there to fine-tune, edit, 
decline, and approve things.
- Level 4: There is no human involvement and the process is fully automated 
by AI, like a self-driving car

#### Why the product manager is the key to the success of AI features:

- Most of current work is at level two. Moving from level two to level three is a product question, not a machine 
learning question. Think about how you start with level two, and then use feedback and other data to move to level three.
- Great AI does not necessarily equal a great product.
- In the end, the product manager controls the roadmap

### AI and the product-led organization

A product-led organization is a business that rallies the entire company around the 
product so each team can leverage it to achieve their most important outcomes. This will help to better understand customers and drive key business outcomes.

#### Six characteristics of product-led organizations:

1. Align each function around the product
2. Make decisions with data over gut feel
3. Use the product as a marketing channel
4. Have amazing onboarding
5. Help users help themselves
6. Collect and use feedback from customers

#### Examples of leveraging AI across a product-led organization:
- AI and machine learning tools can better process and organize data, enabling teams to 
make more—and faster—data-driven decisions.
- AI can analyze user behavior in the product to identify engagement patterns and 
proactively suggest features or content to highlight during onboarding.
- In-product chatbots can interact with users to address pain points, offer recommendations 
to encourage ideal usage, and provide personalized support at scale

###  Powering product-led growth(PLG) with AI

#### 6 Principles of product-lead growth

1. Producing a free user experience 

This is where any PLG strategy with substance has to start. Premised on the idea that there is no better sales vehicle than the product itself. Cumbersome product demos and follow up sequences both take time from sales representatives both take time from sales representatives and become friction points for prospects. Instead teams should let users see the value of product delivers for themselves whenever it's convinient for them.

Types of free user experiences:

 - Free trials - which give the full functionality of the product for a limited time
 - Freemium products - always fre but offer a limited version of the product in terms of functionality, usage and support
 - Product tours - without a free option, you can simulate the experience with which user's can explore your application without ever accessing it or needing to sign up

 2. Delivering an 'aha' moment as soon as possible

Users should experience the product's key benefits as soon as possible.
Many ways to do this, but a very useful one is having an in-app guide that takes users directly to the experience of feature that leads to the 'aha' moment.

3. Commiting to best-in-class usability

Design your free product with optimized UX and usability, not any cluttered or unituitive digital experience.

4. Delighting users to ensure stickiness

Robust feedback mechanisms and quantitative data are crucial here to help product teams decide what features and functionalities to prioritize.

5. Making the purchasing feel like the natural next step.

Have in-app CTA's to take users directly to the purchase plan page

6. Building in virality at every turn

Ability to continually surprise and delight users so that they eventually become evangelists.

###  Making product development smarter

#### What is the product development life cycle?

A cyclical cycle:

- phase 0 - Business outcome - a clear objective to anchor what you want to achieve

- phase 1  - discover - understand the problem's standing in the way of achieving it

Ask questions like what's preventing customer's from retaining at a higher right? what's blocing adoption? what do users need to be more successful.

Uncover and understand the pain points of customers and the larger market.

- phase 2 - determine the right solution for users

- phase 3 - build 

Work with product designers and engineers to ensure your idea comes to life as intended 
or determine how to pivot if needed

- phase 4 - launch

Build a launch plan to ensure customers adopt and continue using new functionality.
Here, you'll work closely with marketing, customer success and sales teams to make a go-to market plan that connects to your target audience and shapes their behaviour.

- phase 5 - evaluate

After you launch, evaluate it sucess with both quantitative and qualitative data.

- phase 6 - iterate
