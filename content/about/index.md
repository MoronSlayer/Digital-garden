I'm passionate about **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, **Data Engineering** and **Analytics**. With the rapid progress of computing power and technology, I believe in the immense potential that data-driven applications can have in our world.

I hold a Master of Science in **Applied Artificial Intelligence** from [Stevens Institute of Technology - Schaefer School of Engineering and Science](https://www.stevens.edu/school-engineering-science), gaining extensive experience with machine learning, deep learning models and analyzing complex data sets to provide informative insights.

I have previously worked as a Full Stack Application developer where I learnt the fundamentals required in the software industry, from version control, code review to deployment on cloud.
