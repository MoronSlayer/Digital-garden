and sound) and often produces more accurate results than traditional machine learning.</li><li><strong>NLP</strong> - technology that helps machines process and

Decision making examples include:</li></ol><ul><li>Product discovery</li><li>Roadmap planning</li><li>Product-led growth strategies</li></ul><ol start=2><li><strong>Experimentation</strong> - Learn what&rsquo;s working and implement changes quickly.
For e.g., AI can suggest what to test for multi-variant feature testing and even run tests automatically</li><li><strong>Communication</strong> - Automate the creation of key product documentation.</li></ol><p>Product managers are constantly communicating about ideas, priorities and plans. With so many cross-functional partners, AI can automate creation of things like user stories, product requirement documents, release notes, and more.</p><hr><p>Product Managers will still require to maintain effective communication, meaning truly being present and communicative with customers, engineers, stakeholders and cross-functional teams.

Premised on the idea that there is no better sales vehicle than the product itself. Cumbersome product demos and follow up sequences both take time from sales representatives both take time from sales representatives and become friction points for prospects.
